# Python MD Tools

Tools for getting data in between the following formats:

- CSV
- JSON
- FrontMatter
- **Markdown**

## Why the name then?

This isn't a comprehensive application and all will be working with data starting from markdown.

There are plenty of ways to work with the other tools but not many that start with data in markdown.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome but I'll need to work on a style guide to make sure things are consistent. (TODO)

## Tools

### MD to JSON

- List Record # get content, link, image, alt-text, url, url-text from a document.
